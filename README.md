# pebble-7-min
7-Minute+ is a simple workout app for your Pebble Smartwatch. It is available for both the original 
black and white Pebbles as well as for the Pebble Time and Pebble Time Round. It consists of twelve 
different thirty second exercises separated by ten second rests, each of which is illustrated by 
an animated stick figure.

Clicking "Select" at any time will pause and resume the exercise, while clicking "Up" or "Down" 
will skip to the previous and next exercises. You can also configure the app to send you pins on 
your timeline reminding you to work out.

Please note, the 7-Minute Workout is not something which I came up with. It was created and 
publicized by the New York Times.
